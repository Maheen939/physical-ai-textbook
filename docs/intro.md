# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** - a comprehensive course that bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment.

## What Makes This Course Unique

This isn't just another robotics tutorial. This course offers:

- **Industry-Aligned Curriculum**: Learn the same tools and frameworks used by leading robotics companies
- **Theory Meets Practice**: Every concept is reinforced with hands-on coding exercises and real-world applications
- **Simulation to Reality**: Progress from safe simulation environments to actual hardware deployment
- **AI-First Approach**: Integrate modern LLMs and vision models with traditional robotics
- **Complete Stack Coverage**: From low-level motor control to high-level cognitive planning

## Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This course introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You will learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## What You'll Learn

This course is structured into four comprehensive modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- ROS 2 middleware for robot control
- Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Physics simulation and environment building
- Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation
- Nav2: Path planning for bipedal humanoid movement

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
- Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language into ROS 2 actions
- Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.
